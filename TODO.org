#+title: Todo

* TODO Write a zig build system for GLFW
* TODO Add GLFW as a dependency (zon)
* TODO Avoid using paths relative to source files (instead of paths relative to root) in [[./.clangd][.clangd]]
- Link to an active issue: https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/1038
- [ ] Workaround: Use shell script to generate your =.clangd=
  =-I${project_dir}/path=
- [ ] Check viability of =compile_commands.json=
* HOLD Error handling for shader compile
Currently, it just segfaults when I try to get InfoLog for shader compile errors.
- This is happening because of libgallium not having debug symbols. (?)
- [ ] But why does it work with C++?
* HOLD Follow ups with zig (in source code)
On hold till json config for clangd is a feature for zig build
